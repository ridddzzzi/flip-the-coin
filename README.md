## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ridddzzzi/flip-the-coin/blob/main/ui.png?raw=true])

This project is a simple coin flipping game created as part of the [DevChallenges.io Flip The Coin](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/flip-the-coin) challenge. The application allows users to "flip" a coin by pressing a button, with the result being either "Heads" or "Tails". The coin images change based on the result, and animations are applied when the button is clicked.

### What I learned

While building this project, I learnt the following concepts:
- Understanding Javascript DOM Principles
- Javascript math function and how to generate a random number

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) - To generate random values for coin flipping.
- [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io) - Platform providing challenges to practice and improve coding skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
  
## Features

- Coin flip action with random outcome of "Heads" or "Tails".
- Dynamic coin images based on the outcome.
